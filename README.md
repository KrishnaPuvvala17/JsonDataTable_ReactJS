# JsonDataTable_ReactJS

1. The main features of the application is commented out within the code ".src/JsonDataDisplay.jsx".

2. If you ever have to add more materials to the lsit in the future, all you have to do is add the material name and its characteristics in the Json format to ".src/data.json" file and it will be reflected onto the application.

3. To make it easier for the vendor, all they have to do is find the required material in the table and select the quantity either by inputting the numbers or by using increment arrow. 
Note: Negative numbers are not allowed and will throw a warning message if entered.
